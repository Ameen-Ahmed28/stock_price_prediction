The project "Real-Time Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series" leverages deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data. Using Yahoo Finance API, real-time stock data is fetched and preprocessed with NumPy and Pandas. The model is built with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in TensorFlow to capture temporal dependencies in stock price movements. Scikit-learn is used for feature scaling and performance evaluation, while Matplotlib provides insightful visualizations. This system enables traders and investors to make data-driven decisions by predicting future stock trends with high accuracy, offering an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for financial forecasting.
